Left sidebar should be collapsible, with drag-and-drop reordering

Main content pane uses block-based editing powered by markdown + rich-text

Right Writi AI panel should support:

Context-aware commands

Streaming answers inline

Suggestions as buttons

Page-level icons and customizable names (e.g., DNA emoji for page)
