Build the header block like Notion. Only display the "Add icon", "Add cover", and "Add comment" buttons when the user hovers over or near the title area. By default, only the large "New Page" title should be visible, left-aligned.

- Add subtle animation on hover (e.g., fade or slide).
- Use semantic HTML and Tailwind.
- Layout: horizontal row of buttons above the title, all left-aligned.
- Use a wrapper div with hover state to toggle visibility of the buttons using Framer Motion.
- Maintain spacing consistent with Notion (around 8px vertical between rows, 16px horizontal between buttons).
