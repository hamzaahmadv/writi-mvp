Create a React component called <FloatingHeaderActions /> that mimics Notion’s header behavior where a row of buttons ("Add icon", "Add cover", "Add comment") floats above the page title and only appears when the user hovers near the title.

**Functional Requirements:**
1. The buttons should appear only when the user moves their mouse into a hover zone above or near the title.
2. Use Tailwind CSS for styling and smooth transition animations.
3. Use absolute positioning to float the buttons above the title, with around 12–16px spacing.
4. Hide the buttons by default using `opacity-0`, and reveal them with `opacity-100` on hover.
5. Add a hover trigger zone (invisible div) above the title that triggers the visibility using `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave`.
6. Animate the appearance of the button row using Framer Motion (fade-in and slide-down effect).
7. Ensure keyboard accessibility by also allowing the actions to appear on `focus-within`.
8. Keep the entire block fully responsive and modular so it can be reused across Writi pages.

**Component Layout:**
- Wrapper div: `relative group`
- Hover trigger zone: invisible div above title
- Floating action row: `absolute -top-8 left-0 flex gap-4`
- Title: `text-3xl font-bold`

Do not hardcode content. Keep buttons as props or separate blocks.

Use clean semantic HTML, TypeScript (if available), and organize with small subcomponents if needed.
