# Notion Blockspeed

Absolutely‚Äîmany of the techniques powering Notion‚Äôs instant block creation can be applied effectively to Writi‚Äôs tech stack. Here‚Äôs how you could integrate them into your architecture:

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è 1. WASM‚ÄëBased SQLite via Web Worker + OPFS
	‚Ä¢	What Notion does: Runs SQLite compiled to WebAssembly inside a Web Worker, writes data to the browser‚Äôs Origin Private File System (OPFS) for persistence, all off the main thread for a smooth UI  Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	How it fits Writi:
	‚Ä¢	Create a dbWorker.ts containing the Worker logic to initialize and query the SQLite WASM instance.
	‚Ä¢	Use @sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm or sql.js, imported and loaded inside the worker.
	‚Ä¢	On page load or when needed, spin up the worker from a client component using new Worker(new URL(...)) (compatible with Next.js 15 Webpack/App Router setup)  Ôøº Ôøº Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	This offloads writes (block inserts, edits) to the worker, preserving the responsiveness of WritiEditor‚Äôs client-side interactions.

‚∏ª

üß† 2. Optimistic UI + Local-First Block Transactions
	‚Ä¢	Inspired by Notion: Blocks are inserted into the UI immediately, then persisted in SQLite and synced remotely, allowing rollback on errors  Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Integration with Writi:
	‚Ä¢	You already use temp IDs and optimistic updates‚Äîcontinue this, but in addition:
	‚Ä¢	After a block is added client-side, queue the transaction to the worker (e.g., INSERT into SQLite).
	‚Ä¢	On successful write, mark the block as ‚Äúpersisted‚Äù; if failure occurs, trigger your rollback flow (which you already support).
	‚Ä¢	This ensures local-first, offline-ready behavior with seamless UI.

‚∏ª

üí≠ 3. Shared Worker for Multi-Tab Sync (Optional)

Notion uses a SharedWorker to ensure only one active worker writes to SQLite to prevent access conflicts  Ôøº Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	If Writi needs multi-tab consistency, consider using a SharedWorker plus web locks to coordinate which tab is active.
	‚Ä¢	Otherwise, single-tab setups are simpler and may suffice for now.

‚∏ª

üîß 4. Next.js Compatibility
	‚Ä¢	Use Next.js with your App Router and Webpack setup; you can integrate WASM and Workers smoothly, as demonstrated by examples  Ôøº Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure you serve .wasm files with correct MIME (application/wasm) and configure output.experiments.syncWebAssembly in next.config.js.

‚∏ª

üåê 5. General Workflow Integration
	1.	User presses Enter ‚Üí WritiEditor instantly inserts a new block with temp ID.
	2.	Send a message to the Worker: "INSERT block..."
	3.	Worker updates SQLite via OPFS and returns success or failure.
	4.	On success, update block status; on failure, rollback client-side.
	5.	In parallel, Server Action (via Supabase/Drizzle) persists to backend.
	6.	Optional: Worker can queue for reconciling local vs remote if offline.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Why This Aligns Perfectly

Benefit	Explanation
Smooth Editing Flow	Offloading DB writes keeps main thread free‚Äîvital for caret movement, Framer Motion animations, Shadcn UI interactions.
Offline-First Capability	SQLite + OPFS allows offline editing and sync on reconnect.
Scalable Architecture	Worker + WASM patterns are compatible with your server actions and Supabase persistence.
TypeScript-Friendly	@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm offers TS types, fitting naturally with your type-safe environment  Ôøº Ôøº Ôøº.
Future Expandability	Enables features like full-text search, differential sync, and real-time collaboration smoothly.


‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Steps for Writi
	1.	Prototype a web worker in dbWorker.ts: initialize SQLite WASM, create block table.
	2.	Bootstrap it in a client component using new Worker(new URL(...)).
	3.	Define messaging protocol: send commands like "INSERT_BLOCK", "DELETE_BLOCK", etc.
	4.	Hook into useBlocks: post optimistic updates and message worker.
	5.	Extend your StorageAdapter: combine client SQLite persistence with Supabase server sync.

‚∏ª

TL;DR

Yes‚ÄîNotion‚Äôs block‚Äëoften‚Äëfocused WASM + Web Worker + OPFS architecture aligns beautifully with Writi. It can bring ultra-smooth UI, offline editing, and powerful performance to your Next.js + Supabase editor with minimal friction.

# Setup guide

Here‚Äôs how you can seamlessly integrate Notion‚Äëstyle block creation using WASM‚Äëbased SQLite in a Web Worker into your Writi tech stack:

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è 1. Setup SQLite‚ÄëWASM + OPFS Web Worker

Install the official library:

npm install @sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm

Then create lib/dbWorker.ts as a web worker:

import { sqlite3Worker1Promiser } from '@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm';

const ready = sqlite3Worker1Promiser({ onready: () => {} });

self.onmessage = async (ev) => {
  const { id, cmd, payload } = ev.data;
  const promiser = await ready;
  try {
    let res;
    if (cmd === 'init') {
      res = await promiser('open', {
        filename: 'file:writi.sqlite3?vfs=opfs'
      });
    } else if (cmd === 'exec') {
      res = await promiser('exec', {
        dbId: payload.dbId,
        sql: payload.sql,
        bind: payload.bind
      });
    }
    postMessage({ id, result: res });
  } catch (e) {
    postMessage({ id, error: String(e) });
  }
};

	‚Ä¢	Uses OPFS in a background worker for persistent writes  Ôøº Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Message-based API (cmd: 'init' | 'exec') offloads DB ops from the UI thread.

‚∏ª

üîå 2. Load Worker from WritiEditor

In a client component (e.g. WritiEditor.tsx):

const worker = useMemo(
  () => new Worker(new URL('../lib/dbWorker.ts', import.meta.url), { type: 'module'}),
  []
);

const send = useCallback((cmd, payload) =>
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const id = String(Math.random());
    worker.postMessage({ id, cmd, payload });
    const onMsg = ev => {
      if (ev.data.id === id) {
        worker.removeEventListener('message', onMsg);
        ev.data.error ? reject(ev.data.error) : resolve(ev.data.result);
      }
    };
    worker.addEventListener('message', onMsg);
  }),
  [worker]
);

useEffect(() => {
  send('init', {});
}, [send]);

	‚Ä¢	Uses new URL(..., import.meta.url) to ensure .wasm is served correctly  Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Ensures CI needs webpack.experiments.asyncWebAssembly = true and server headers COOP/COEP  Ôøº.

‚∏ª

üß± 3. Hook into Block Creation (onEnter)

In your useBlocks or UI logic:

async function onEnter(newBlock) {
  dispatch({ type: 'add_block', block: newBlock }); // Optimistic UI
  try {
    await send('exec', {
      dbId: dbId,
      sql: `INSERT INTO blocks (id,parentId,type,content,position) VALUES (?,?,?,?,?);`,
      bind: [
        newBlock.id,
        newBlock.parentId,
        newBlock.type,
        newBlock.content,
        newBlock.position
      ]
    });
    // Mark persistence success (optional)
  } catch (err) {
    rollback(newBlock.id);
  }
}

	‚Ä¢	Reflects immediate visual creation while DB write happens off the main thread.
	‚Ä¢	Your rollback strategy aligns perfectly here.

‚∏ª

üß© 4. Tie into Your Storage Adapter

Integrate SQLite persistence with existing Supabase sync:

useEffect(() => {
  if (newBlock.temp) {
    onEnter(newBlock);
    persistBlockServer(newBlock); // Server Action to Supabase
  }
}, [newBlock]);

	‚Ä¢	Immediate local DB storage + later remote storage.
	‚Ä¢	Supports offline-first experiences with eventual consistency.

‚∏ª

üåê 5. (Optional) SharedWorker for Multi-tab

To handle multi-tab support, consider a SharedWorker with web locks, mirroring Notion‚Äôs structure  Ôøº Ôøº Ôøº Ôøº. This ensures only one tab writes to the OPFS-backed SQLite, while others proxy through.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Summary

Feature	Benefit
WASM + OPFS in Worker	Fast, persistent local storage without blocking UI  Ôøº
Optimistic block creation	Seamless typing experience with instant feedback
Next.js integration	Works with Webpack, .wasm serving, async WASM setup ()
Offline + Sync-ready	Local-first design with server fallback via Supabase
Scalable to tabs	Multi-tab support optional via SharedWorker


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Next Steps
	1.	Add SQLite-WASM + OPFS worker setup (dbWorker.ts).
	2.	Wire it up in WritiEditor using new Worker(...) + send() helper.
	3.	Hook into onEnter for block insert operations.
	4.	Integrate ARTFLOW with Supabase persistence.
	5.	(Optional) Add SharedWorker if you plan multi-tab editing.
