üß† Notion‚Äôs Smooth Editor Experience vs Writi ‚Äî Deep Dive & Execution Roadmap

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principles Behind Notion‚Äôs Smoothness

1. Everything is a Block
	‚Ä¢	Every item ‚Äî text, images, pages ‚Äî is a block with a UUID v4
	‚Ä¢	Hierarchical: blocks reference parentId, enabling nesting
	‚Ä¢	Seamless block type transformation

2. Client-Side SQLite (WASM)
	‚Ä¢	Notion moved from IndexedDB to SQLite in WebAssembly
	‚Ä¢	Benefits:
	‚Ä¢	Works around storage quotas
	‚Ä¢	Enables fast, complex queries
	‚Ä¢	Efficient local caching

3. Optimistic Updates

updateBlockLocally(blockId, newContent);
syncToServer(blockId, newContent).catch(() => {
  revertBlock(blockId, previousContent);
});

	‚Ä¢	UI never blocked
	‚Ä¢	Async rollback if needed

4. Virtual Scrolling
	‚Ä¢	Renders only visible blocks + buffer
	‚Ä¢	Enables performance for thousands of blocks

5. Smart Debouncing
	‚Ä¢	100‚Äì300ms debounce for typing
	‚Ä¢	Reduces load without harming responsiveness

6. Efficient Editing
	‚Ä¢	Uses contenteditable
	‚Ä¢	Manages DOM state outside React
	‚Ä¢	Keyboard shortcuts and markdown triggers

7. Real-Time Collaboration
	‚Ä¢	Uses Operational Transformation (OT)
	‚Ä¢	Server coordinates ops, client syncs diff
	‚Ä¢	Fast local UI changes, consistent shared state

8. Local-First Perception

const block = createBlockLocally();
renderBlock(block);
syncToBackend(block);

	‚Ä¢	Instant rendering + background durability

9. Smart Caching & Loading
	‚Ä¢	Preload next blocks/pages
	‚Ä¢	Lazy-load heavy elements (PDFs, embeds)
	‚Ä¢	Stale-while-revalidate for freshness

‚úÖ What Writi Has Implemented So Far

Feature	Status	Notes
Optimistic updates with rollback	‚úÖ	temp_${timestamp} pattern used
100ms typing debounce	‚úÖ	Same as Notion‚Äôs sweet spot

Slash command & markdown triggers	‚úÖ	Early version working


‚∏ª

üîç Gaps & Missing Features

Feature	Missing?	Why Important
Virtual Scrolling	‚ùå	Prevents DOM overload with large docs
WASM SQLite local DB	‚ùå	Faster queries, true local-first UX
TransactionQueue	‚ùå	Resilient async syncing of edits
Breadth-first page loading	‚ùå	Fast render of large documents
Multi-tab coordination	‚ùå	Prevents sync conflicts
Real-time collaboration	‚ùå	Enables shared editing like Notion

üöÄ Execution Roadmap to Match Notion

‚úÖ Phase 1: WASM SQLite + OPFS + Web Worker
	‚Ä¢	Use absurd-sql, vulcan-sqlite, or sql.js
	‚Ä¢	Store DB in OPFS inside Web Worker
	‚Ä¢	Use Comlink to expose:
	‚Ä¢	getBlocksPage(pageId)
	‚Ä¢	upsertBlock(block)

Claude Prompt:

Create a WASM SQLite DB inside a Web Worker using OPFS. Expose Comlink functions for reading and writing block records.


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 2: TransactionQueue with Sync & Rollback
	‚Ä¢	Queue: Insert local edits to transactions table
	‚Ä¢	Sync: Background process flushes to Supabase
	‚Ä¢	Rollback: On failure, revert UI & mark failed

Claude Prompt:

Build a client-side TransactionQueue using SQLite. Queue edits, sync with Supabase, and rollback on failure.


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 3: Breadth-First Page Load
	‚Ä¢	Fetch top-level blocks on page open
	‚Ä¢	Children fetched lazily on scroll or expand

Claude Prompt:

Implement breadth-first block loading with getBlocksPage(pageId) for immediate top-level render.


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 4: SharedWorker Multi-Tab Coordination
	‚Ä¢	Web Lock API + SharedWorker
	‚Ä¢	One tab manages DB writes
	‚Ä¢	Broadcasts sync events

Claude Prompt:

Use SharedWorker + Web Locks to coordinate active tab writing to SQLite and broadcasting to others.


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 5: Real-Time Sync
	‚Ä¢	Use Supabase Realtime
	‚Ä¢	On change, update local SQLite + in-memory state
	‚Ä¢	Merge changes with version/timestamp resolution

Claude Prompt:

Subscribe to Supabase Realtime changes for blocks. Merge updates into local SQLite and React UI.


‚∏ª

üèÅ Final Goal: Notion-Level Smoothness

Once implemented, Writi will support:
	‚Ä¢	Offline-first block editing
	‚Ä¢	Lightning-fast page rendering
	‚Ä¢	Deferred durable syncing
	‚Ä¢	Multi-tab consistency
	‚Ä¢	Real-time collaboration

Just like Notion ‚Äî but with your own Claude-powered twist üí°

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Appendix: Engineering Notes from Notion Research

üß© Instant Block Creation: What Happens on Enter

onEnterPress() {
  const newBlockId = generateUUID();
  const newBlock = {
    id: newBlockId,
    type: 'text',
    properties: { title: [''] },
    parent: currentPageId,
    created_time: Date.now()
  };
  insertBlockAfterCurrent(newBlock);
  moveCursorToBlock(newBlockId);
  queueTransaction({ operations: [createBlockOperation(newBlock)] });
}

‚ö° Optimistic Update Flow
	‚Ä¢	UI updates instantly using temp ID
	‚Ä¢	Server sync happens in background
	‚Ä¢	Temp ID replaced with UUID from server
	‚Ä¢	UI rollback if sync fails

üìâ Key Performance Techniques
	‚Ä¢	Keydown-to-Paint optimization
	‚Ä¢	Memoized expensive operations (cookie parsing, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	ProseMirror selection + GPU-based cursor animations
	‚Ä¢	CSS transforms + event batching
	‚Ä¢	Debounced 100ms auto-save

üß± Block Data Structure

{
  id: 'uuid-v4',
  type: 'text',
  properties: { title: ['Hello World'] },
  content: ['child-block-id-1', 'child-block-id-2'],
  parent: 'parent-block-id',
  created_time: ..., last_edited_time: ...
}

	‚Ä¢	Lightweight, lazily loaded children
	‚Ä¢	Referential block structure (ID only)

üéØ Cursor Management Example

const blockElement = document.querySelector(`[data-block-id="${blockId}"]`);
blockElement.focus();
const selection = window.getSelection();
const range = document.createRange();
range.setStart(blockElement, 0);
range.collapse(true);
selection.removeAllRanges();
selection.addRange(range);

üîÑ Real-Time & Transaction Model

{
  id: 'transaction-uuid',
  operations: [
    {
      command: 'set',
      table: 'blocks',
      id: 'block-uuid',
      path: ['properties', 'title'],
      args: [['New text content']]
    }
  ]
}

	‚Ä¢	Operational Transformation or CRDT for consistency
	‚Ä¢	Version vectors used to track doc state

üß† Performance Metrics to Track
	‚Ä¢	Keydown to Paint
	‚Ä¢	Block Creation Latency
	‚Ä¢	Typing Responsiveness
	‚Ä¢	Page Navigation Time
	‚Ä¢	Collaborative Update Delay

üß™ Optimization Summary
	‚Ä¢	Pre-allocated DOM nodes
	‚Ä¢	Code-splitting editor logic
	‚Ä¢	React.memo to prevent rerenders
	‚Ä¢	Event delegation for block handlers

This technical foundation gives Writi a blueprint to match Notion‚Äôs world-class responsiveness, using Claude to iteratively implement, measure, and optimize each layer.
