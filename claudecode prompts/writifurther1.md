✨ Writi: Further Enhancements Beyond Notion

This file outlines advanced features you can add to Writi to match (or exceed) the smoothness, intelligence, and UX of Notion.

⸻

✅ Overview

You’ve already implemented:
	•	Local-first editing (WASM SQLite + OPFS)
	•	Optimistic updates with rollback
	•	Breadth-first loading and virtual scrolling
	•	Realtime collaboration (Supabase Realtime)
	•	Multi-tab sync (SharedWorker + Web Locks)

To further improve Writi, consider adding the following enhancements.

⸻

🧩 1. Block Transformation UI (Any block → Any block)

Goal: Let users convert any block type to another (like Notion’s block switcher)

Implementation Plan:
	•	Add a slash-command or context menu to each block
	•	Use a dropdown with icons to convert:
	•	Paragraph → Heading
	•	Heading → Quote
	•	Code → Paragraph
	•	Sync transformation with both local SQLite and Supabase

Claude Prompt:

Add a contextual block type switcher. When a user clicks the block toolbar, show a dropdown to convert the current block into any supported type. Update both local state and server with the new type.


⸻

🧱 2. Drag-and-Drop with GPU Acceleration

Goal: Enable buttery-smooth block reordering using @dnd-kit and translateY

Implementation Plan:
	•	Use @dnd-kit/sortable or framer-motion for smooth dragging
	•	Apply transform: translateY() instead of layout-based positioning
	•	Animate drop-in/out with spring motion

Claude Prompt:

Implement block reordering using @dnd-kit with GPU-accelerated translateY animations. Update local and server block positions on drop. Ensure compatibility with virtual scrolling.


⸻

🧠 3. Claude-Powered AI Block Actions

Goal: Add AI-enhanced editing features inside the block toolbar

Suggested Features:
	•	✨ Rewrite block
	•	🧠 Summarize selection
	•	🔍 Clarify paragraph
	•	🛠 Fix grammar

Claude Prompt:

Enhance the block toolbar with AI actions like Summarize, Rewrite, and Fix Grammar. Use Claude to analyze the block content and replace or insert suggestions. Keep UI minimal.


⸻

🔮 4. Predictive Prefetching for Faster UX

Goal: Make Writi feel faster by loading content before users need it

Implementation Plan:
	•	Preload next 3 blocks on scroll/focus
	•	If parent block is expanded, fetch its children in background
	•	Use idle time (requestIdleCallback) to warm up block data

Claude Prompt:

Add predictive prefetching to the editor. When a user focuses a block, preload the next 2–3 blocks and their metadata. Use requestIdleCallback to avoid blocking the main thread.


⸻

📈 5. Performance Metrics and Insights

Goal: Track how fast Writi actually performs and optimize based on real data

Implementation Plan:
	•	Use performance.now() to track:
	•	Keydown-to-Paint time
	•	Block creation latency
	•	Sync confirmation time
	•	Send data to PostHog for analysis

Claude Prompt:

Instrument the editor with performance markers like block creation latency and keydown-to-paint. Send metrics to PostHog using custom events.


⸻

🧩 Optional Bonus Features

Feature	Idea	Claude Prompt
📝 Block Templates	Insert pre-filled layouts	Add /template command for reusable block sets
💬 Block Comments	Inline discussion	Add commentBlockAction + UI badge indicator
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 AI Co-Editing Agent	Claude watches page + suggests edits	WritiAiPanel observes typing + offers completions


⸻

✅ Summary

These enhancements take Writi beyond feature parity with Notion, giving it a uniquely fast, AI-enhanced, and scalable UX.

Start with:
	•	Block transformation UI
	•	Drag-and-drop block reordering
	•	AI block actions
	•	Predictive prefetching
	•	Performance metrics

Then iterate toward:
	•	Templates, comments, co-editing agents

Each feature includes Claude-friendly prompts and can be built incrementally inside Cursor.
